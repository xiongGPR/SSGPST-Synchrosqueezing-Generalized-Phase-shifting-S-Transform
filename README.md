# SSGPST-Synchrosqueezing-Generalized-Phase-shifting-S-Transform-
Synchrosqueezing Generalized Phase-shifting S-Transform

The package contains the following files: 

synsq_gpst_fw.m: Synchrosqueezing-Generalized-Phase-shifting-S-Transform (SS-GPST).

synsq_gpst_iw.m: The inverse transform of SS-GPST.

synsq_Fgpst_iw.m: The fast inverse transform of SS-GPST.

synsq_st_fw.m: Synchrosqueezing S-Transform (SS-ST).

synsq_st_iw.m: The inverse transform of SS-ST.

GPST_fw.m:  Generalized-Phase-shifting-S-Transform (GPST).

S_transfom.m: S-Transform (ST).

phase_gpst.m: Calculate the phase transform of GPST at each (frequency,time) pair. It is an intermediate function for calculating SS-GPST.

phase_st.m:  Calculate the phase transform of ST at each (frequency,time) pair. It is an intermediate function for calculating SS-ST.

pixel_connect_dnosing.m: Pixel-connectivity filter used in Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data. Using it, threshold filtering can be implemented in the TF domain of SS-GPST, and the examples in the article can be verified.

GPR_data.mat: raw data came from a tunnel detection task by a vehicle-mounted GPR equipped with 350MHz air-coupled antenna in the Lianghekou Tunnel of Jiuzhaigou-Mianyang Expressway in China.

Synthesis test.m: Examples and data for synthetic signal testing. It is also an example of how to run SS-GPST and its signal reconstruction.
